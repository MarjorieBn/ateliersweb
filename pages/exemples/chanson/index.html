<article>
    <p>
    Tom Joad got out of the old McAlester Pen;<br>
    There he got his parole.<br>
    After four long years on a man killing charge,<br>
    Tom Joad come a-walkin’ down the road, poor boy,<br>
    Tom Joad come a-walkin’ down the road.
    </p>
    <p>Tom Joad, he met a truck driving man;<br>
    There he caught him a ride.<br>
    He said, “<i>I just got loose from McAlester Pen<br>
    On a charge called homicide,<br>
    A charge called homicide.</i>”
    </p>
    <p>That truck rolled away in a cloud of dust;<br>
    Tommy turned his face toward home.<br>
    He met Preacher Casey, and they had a little drink,<br>
    But they found that his family they was gone,<br>
    He found that his family they was gone.
    </p>
    <p>He found his mother’s old-fashion shoe,<br>
    Found his daddy’s hat.<br>
    And he found little Muley and Muley said,<br>
    “<i>They’ve been tractored out by the cats,<br>
    They’ve been tractored out by the cats.</i>”
    </p>
    <p>Tom Joad walked down to the neighbor’s farm,<br>
    Found his family.<br>
    They took Preacher Casey and loaded in a car,<br>
    And his mother said, “<i>We’ve got to get away.</i>”<br>
    His mother said, “<i>We’ve got to get away.</i>”
    </p>
    <p>Now, the twelve of the Joads made a mighty heavy load;<br>
    But Grandpa Joad did cry.<br>
    He picked up a handful of land in his hand,<br>
    Said: “<i>I’m stayin’ with the farm till I die.<br>
    Yes, I’m stayin’ with the farm till I die.</i>”
    </p>
    <p>They fed him short ribs and coffee and soothing syrup;<br>
    And Grandpa Joad did die.<br>
    They buried Grandpa Joad by the side of the road,<br>
    Grandma on the California side,<br>
    They buried Grandma on the California side.
    </p>
    <p>They stood on a mountain and they looked to the west,<br>
    And it looked like the promised land.<br>
    That bright green valley with a river running through,<br>
    There was work for every single hand, they thought,<br>
    There was work for every single hand.
    </p>
    <p>The Joads rolled away to the jungle camp,<br>
    There they cooked a stew.<br>
    And the hungry little kids of the jungle camp<br>
    Said: “<i>We’d like to have some, too.</i>”<br>
    Said: “<i>We’d like to have some, too.</i>”
    </p>
    <p>Now a deputy sheriff fired loose at a man,<br>
    Shot a woman in the back.<br>
    Before he could take his aim again,<br>
    Preacher Casey dropped him in his track, poor boy,<br>
    Preacher Casey dropped him in his track.
    </p>
    <p>They handcuffed Casey and they took him in jail;<br>
    And then he got away.<br>
    And he met Tom Joad on the old river bridge,<br>
    And these few words he did say, poor boy,<br>
    These few words he did say.
    </p>
    <p>“<i>I preached for the Lord a mighty long time,<br>
    Preached about the rich and the poor.<br>
    Us workin’ folkses, all get together,<br>
    ’Cause we ain’t got a chance anymore.<br>
    We ain’t got a chance anymore.</i>”
    </p>
    <p>Now, the deputies come, and Tom and Casey run<br>
    To the bridge where the water run down.<br>
    But the vigilante thugs hit Casey with a club,<br>
    They laid Preacher Casey on the ground, poor Casey,<br>
    They laid Preacher Casey on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>Tom Joad, he grabbed that deputy’s club,<br>
    Hit him over the head.<br>
    Tom Joad took flight in the dark rainy night,<br>
    And a deputy and a preacher lying dead, two men,<br>
    A deputy and a preacher lying dead.
    </p>
    <p>Tom run back where his mother was asleep;<br>
    He woke her up out of bed.<br>
    An’ he kissed goodbye to the mother that he loved,<br>
    Said what Preacher Casey said, Tom Joad,<br>
    He said what Preacher Casey said.
    </p>
    <p>“<i>Ever’body might be just one big soul,<br>
    Well it looks that a-way to me.<br>
    Everywhere that you look, in the day or night,<br>
    That’s where I’m a-gonna be, Ma,<br>
    That’s where I’m a-gonna be.</i>
    </p>
    <p><i>Wherever little children are hungry and cry,<br>
    Wherever people ain’t free.<br>
    Wherever men are fightin’ for their rights,<br>
    That’s where I’m a-gonna be, Ma.<br>
    That’s where I’m a-gonna be.</i>”
