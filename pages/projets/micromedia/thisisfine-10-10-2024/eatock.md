# Daniel Eatock: Mini-Manifesto

Begin with ideas  
Embrace chance  
Celebrate coincidence  
Ad-lib and make things up  
Eliminate superfluous elements  
Subvert expectation  
Make something difficult look easy  
Be first or last  
Believe complex ideas can produce simple things 
Trust the process  
Allow concepts to determine form  
Reduce material and production to their essence  
Sustain the integrity of an idea  
Propose honesty as a solution
